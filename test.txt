Good morning!

Here's a solution to yesterday's problem.
[https://dailycodingproblem.com/solution/216?token=cd412d83a05a9eef5dffd1dffb5a0fdbc199db2ad06db8946a9269bb7b1818547b37491a]

This is your coding interview problem for today.

This problem was asked by Oracle.

We say a number is sparse if there are no adjacent ones in its binary
representation. For example, 21 (10101) is sparse, but 22 (10110) is not. For a
given input N, find the smallest sparse number greater than or equal to N.

Do this in faster than O(N log N) time.

We will be sending the solution tomorrow, along with tomorrow's question. As
always, feel free to shoot us an email if there's anything we can help with.

Have a great day!
