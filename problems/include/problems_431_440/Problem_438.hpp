/* EASY
Implement a stack API using only a heap. A stack implements the following
methods:

 * push(item), which adds an element to the stack
 * pop(), which removes and returns the most recently added element (or throws
   an error if there is nothing on the stack)

Recall that a heap has the following operations:

 * push(item), which adds a new key to the heap
 * pop(), which removes and returns the max value of the heap
