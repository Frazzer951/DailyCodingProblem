/* MEDIUM
Write a function that takes in a number, string, list, or dictionary and returns
its JSON encoding. It should also handle nulls.

For example, given the following input:

[None, 123, ["a", "b"], {"c":"d"}]


You should return the following, as a string:

'[null, 123, ["a", "b"], {"c": "d"}]'
