/* EASY
You are given a string formed by concatenating several words corresponding to
the integers zero through nine and then anagramming.

For example, the input could be 'niesevehrtfeev', which is an anagram of
'threefiveseven'. Note that there can be multiple instances of each integer.

Given this string, return the original integers in sorted order. In the example
above, this would be 357.
