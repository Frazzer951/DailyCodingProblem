/* EASY
The United States uses the imperial system of weights and measures, which means
that there are many different, seemingly arbitrary units to measure distance.
There are 12 inches in a foot, 3 feet in a yard, 22 yards in a chain, and so on
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_units#Length].

Create a data structure that can efficiently convert a certain quantity of one
unit to the correct amount of any other unit. You should also allow for
additional units to be added to the system.
