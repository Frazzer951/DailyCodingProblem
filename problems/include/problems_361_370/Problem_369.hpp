Youâ€™re tracking stock price at a given instance of time. Implement an API with
the following functions: add(), update(), remove(), which adds/updates/removes a
datapoint for the stock price you are tracking. The data is given as (timestamp,
price), where timestamp is specified in unix epoch time.

Also, provide max(), min(), and average() functions that give the
max/min/average of all values seen thus far.
