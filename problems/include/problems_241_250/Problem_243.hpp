/* MEDIUM
Given an array of numbers N and an integer k, your task is to split N into k
partitions such that the maximum sum of any partition is minimized. Return this
sum.

For example, given N = [5, 1, 2, 7, 3, 4] and k = 3, you should return 8, since
the optimal partition is [5, 1, 2], [7], [3, 4].
