/* MEDIUM
Given a list of words, determine whether the words can be chained to form a
circle. A word X can be placed in front of another word Y in a circle if the
last character of X is same as the first character of Y.

For example, the words ['chair', 'height', 'racket', touch', 'tunic'] can form
the following circle: chair --> racket --> touch --> height --> tunic --> chair.
